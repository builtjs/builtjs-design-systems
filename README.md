# Built.js Design Systems

A design system is a comprehensive framework that provides a set of reusable components, guidelines, and standards to ensure consistency in the design and development of products. It includes visual elements like typography, color schemes, and icons, as well as interactive elements like buttons, forms, and navigation patterns. A design system promotes collaboration between designers and developers by standardizing components, improving efficiency, and maintaining a cohesive user experience.

Built.js community themes and plugins are required to adhere to a design system.

Each design system contains the following files and directories:
- styles
    - ```index.css```
    - ```globals.css```
- ```tailwind.config.js```

To find a previous versions of a design system, please check this repository's branches.

These are the Built.js design systems:
- [Basic](/design-systems/basic/README.md)
- [ShadCN](/design-systems/shadcn/README.md)

To contribute to a design system or create a new one, please check the [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
